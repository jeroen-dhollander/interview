   - knapsack problem
   - Reduction: Solve a problem using a well known solution for another Problem
                Example: using sum(x, y) we can implement a sum_n(a, b, c, ...)

    Memoization

    - heuristic search methods? Not needed I think, but starts on page 247 of the book

Substring:
    * Find using hashing:
         Use a rolling hash mechanism, calculate the hash for substring
         and all possible substrings, then compare hashes
         --> complexity O(n + m) - probably (unless lots of collisions)

DataStructures

TODO:

Trees:
  - traverse in/pre/post order
  - BFS vs DFS
  - implement binary/n-ary tree in array/...
  - algorithms to traverse/insert/delete/balance
  - You should be familiar with at least one flavor of balanced binary tree,
    whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree.
    You should actually know how it's implemented.

Graphs
  - Know your graph algorithms as well.
       distance
       Searches
       Connectivity
       Cycle-detection
       ...
  - Know at least one algorithm for finding the shortest path on different types of graphs.
  - Graph coloring problem?
  - BFS vs DFS
  - There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory
    (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list),
    and you should familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros and cons.
  - Dijkstra and A*
  - Whenever someone gives you a problem, think graphs
<---- REALLY NEED TO WORK ON GRAPH KNOWLEDGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

DESIGN INTERVIEW
-----------------

   https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/technical-design-interview-guide-success-joey-addona/?trk=mp-reader-card

   1) Find the requirements/restrictions
   2) Break down the problem
   3) Don't be messy (aka break down, and work from left to right)
   4) Communicate, Ask questions: Say why you do things, ask about restrictions/focus
   5) Know how to scale

       return k == state.n

          pos
          for pos in state.available_positions
